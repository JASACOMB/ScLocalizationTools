+ Aciedo_RepUI_Description=Following the conclusion of the First Tevarin War, Humanity was eager to begin exploring the stars again. Aciedo began life as fledging ship manufacturer focused on creating long-range exploration vessels. While they saw moderate success with their initial ship design, it was the included communication drones that stood out for their reliability and transmission success. Captains across the newly formed Empire began asking Aciedo to sell them commdrones directly. Within the first year of offering them, sales skyrocketed, and it wasn't long before Aciedo decided to stop manufacturing ships entirely. Today, they are the UEE's largest communication service provider, handling over 70% of all comms, and operate commrelays, commarrays, and commdrones across the Empire.

+ Adagio_RepUI_Description=Founded by retired Naval logistics personnel, Adagio found success supporting the voracious resource appetite of the Messer-era military-industrial complex through their salvaging operations. After the end of the Messer regime, Adagio, like many other military contractors, lost their contract, and the company was forced to find new sources of revenue. This ultimately led Adagio begin reselling salvage rights theyâ€™ve acquired to independent captains and other enterprises of various sizes.

+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Announce_Mission_Siege_PreMission_IG_003_AttentionAnElevated,P=Attention, an elevated threat level is being issued for Crusader. We are unable to share details at this time, but if you are a CDF Volunteer or are interested in volunteering, please make your way to Orison.
+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionArea_HardIsland_Siege_DefeatAA_MiniBossDead_IG_001_HeresTheSituation,P=Here's the situation. The lieutenant on this platform's been taken out, but the anti-air is still online. You aren't going to find a shuttle to get to the Admin Center, so you'll need to get the anti-air offline and commandeer a vehicle to get there.
+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionArea_HardIsland_Siege_DefeatAA_MiniBossDead_IG_002_WantedToGive,P=Wanted to give you a quick update. CDF volunteers have taken out this platform's lieutenant but the anti-air's still active. Since there isn't a direct shuttle between this platform and the Admin Center, you'll need to take out this AA in order to safely commandeer a ship.
+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionArea_HardIsland_Siege_DefeatAA_MiniBossDead_IG_003_JustAHeads,P=Just a head's up. The lieutenant on Hartmoore's been taken out, but its anti-air system is still active. You'll need to take that out before you can commandeer a vehicle to get to Admin Center. You won't find any shuttles that'll take you there.
+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionArea_Siege_AreaObjCleared_IG_001_TheLieutenantAnd,P=The lieutenant and anti-air on this platform have both been taken care of. You should be good to move onto the next one.
+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionArea_Siege_AreaObjCleared_IG_002_ThisPlatformsLieutenant,P=This platform's lieutenant has been neutralized and the anti-air secured, so you can move on.
+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionArea_Siege_AreaObjCleared_IG_003_WithTheAntiAir,P=With the anti-air secure and the Lieutenant dealt with, there's not much left to do on the platform. Go ahead and move onto one of the active areas.
+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionArea_Siege_DefeatAA_MiniBossDead_IG_001_JustAHeads,P=Just a head's up, the Nine Tails lieutenant on this island's been dealt with, but the anti-air is still online. You'll need to disable that if you want to commandeer a ship to the next island. Otherwise, you'll need to take the shuttle.
+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionArea_Siege_DefeatAA_MiniBossDead_IG_002_ThisPlatformsLieutenant,P=This platform's lieutenant has been taken care of, but you won't be able to safely commandeer any ships unless you disable the anti-air. The shuttles are still active to take you to the other platforms though.
+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionArea_Siege_DefeatAA_MiniBossDead_IG_003_JustWantedTo,P=Just wanted to send the latest intel. The lieutenant on this platform's been neutralized but the anti-air net's still online. If you want to commandeer a ship from here you'll need to disable it. Otherwise, there's an active shuttle to the next platform.
+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionArea_VeryHardIsland_Siege_DefeatAA_MiniBossDead_IG_001_QuickStatusUpdate,P=Quick status update. The Admin Center's lieutenant has been taken out. There's still anti-air coverage but latest intel suggests the IFFI for this platform is located on the barge, not this island. So you'll need to go there to shut it down. You can still destroy the turrets up close if you want.
+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionArea_VeryHardIsland_Siege_DefeatAA_MiniBossDead_IG_002_HeresTheLowdown,P=Here's the lowdown. The lieutenant of this platform's already been neutralized but the anti-air is still operational. We think the IFFI controlling this airspace is located on the barge, so you can either find it there or take out the turrets yourself.
+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionArea_VeryHardIsland_Siege_DefeatAA_MiniBossDead_IG_003_JustSomeIntel,P=Just some intel as you approach Admin Center. The lieutenant's been taken out but CDF volunteers haven't found an IFFI here. We think that the anti-air is being controlled from the barge, so I'd start searching there unless you want to blow them up yourself.
+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionObj_WithSuppliesAboard_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_FirstOccur_IG_001_LooksLikeYoure,P=Looks like you're almost at Jericho. To get any supplies you have unloaded faster, use one of the kiosks and the Quartermaster will offload the cargo for you.

+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Cancelled_Mission_PlayerOutside_Siege_IG_003_HeyHateTo,P=Hey, hate to change things up on you after you volunteered, but our people have been making such great progress against the Nine Tails, that logistically it doesn't make much sense for you to join the operation. You are dismissed. Be safe out there and thanks again.
+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Cancelled_Mission_Siege_IG_001_AttentionCdfVolunteers,P=Attention, CDF Volunteers. Crusader Security has decided to take back control of this operation effective immediately. I need all CDF to vacate the platforms and clear the area.

+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Delayed_Vehicle_Idris_Showdown_aAlly_tEnemy_FromAlly_TargetIncoming_IG_003_ThoseXenothreatReinforcements,P=Those XenoThreat reinforcements are taking their sweet time getting here. I want everyone to hold their positions until they arrive.
+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Destroyed_Vehicle_PlayerShip_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_001_WordOfWarning,P=Word of warning, we seem to have a third party in the area attacking CDF ships. Keep an eye out.
+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Destroyed_Vehicle_PlayerShip_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_002_HeadsUpWere,P=Heads up. We're getting reports that unaffiliated ships are attacking CDF volunteers. Be careful.
+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Destroyed_Vehicle_PlayerShip_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_003_AsIfWe,P=As if we didn't have enough to worry about, it seems we got interlopers attacking our ships. They dont' seem to be XenoThreat, but they're very much a threat. Be on guard.
+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Encourage_MissionObj_ProtectFlagship_UntilQT_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_TheJavelinIs,P=The Javelin is wondering where their protection detail is. Get going.

+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Encourage_MissionObj_ProtectFlagship_UntilQT_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_INeedYou,P=I need you to stay with the Javelin. Watch their back until they QT.
+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Intro_MissionObj_Siege_FindTerminalCode_IG_001_NotTooMuch,P=Not too much of a surprise that they locked their system. Maybe see if you can find a code somewhere.
+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Intro_MissionObj_Siege_FindTerminalCode_IG_002_ShitLooksLike,P=Shit, looks like you need a code to access the terminal. You're gonna have to find it somewhere.
+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Intro_MissionObj_Siege_FindTerminalCode_IG_003_LockedYouMight,P=Locked... You might be able to find the access code somewhere.

+ PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Request_MissionObj_ProtectFlagship_UntilQT_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_AlrightTheJavelin,P=Alright, the Javelin is almost ready to QT. Need you to protect them until they've quantumed away from the station. Don't want to risk anything happening to them now.

+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Constellation_IG_001_EveryoneLovesTo=Everyone loves to argue which Connie is the best, but that's like arguing what amount of free money is the best. What I'm trying to say is that they're such a fantastic ship, you really can't go wrong with whichever one you fly.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Crucible_IG_001_TheCrucibleIs=The Crucible is some pretty incredible engineering. Thing is basically a flying toolbox. They can fix up most problems a pilot can run into. If that's not a great skill to have, don't know what is.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Cutlass_IG_001_SolidOffenseDecent=Solid offense, decent defense, not too shabby of a hold, easy to take care of, and an interesting reputation to say the least. A lot of people think the Cutlass is a great investment, and I'm tempted to agree.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Cyclone_IG_001_TheNewTumbril=The new Tumbril really outdid themselves with the Cyclone. I had an old homesteader in just the other week telling me that she had been riding in one of the originals for decades, and didn't once think about giving it up until she saw the new ones. Not only did she buy the new one, but she told me that she's gonna keep the old one on her porch just to sit in. How about that?
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Dragonfly_IG_001_TheDragonflyIs=The Dragonfly is less of a ship and more of a lifestyle.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Eclipse_IG_001_OhIsThere=Oh, is there an Eclipse here? Thing's so stealthy I almost didn't notice it. Just kidding with ya. But seriously, thing's as silent of a predator as they come.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Endeavor_IG_001_TheEndeavorIs=The Endeavor is less of a ship and more of a roaming university. It's all a little bit beyond me, if I'm being honest, but I have it on good authority that if you're in the market for a scientific vessel, this is the one you want.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_F8Lightning_IG_001_ILoveThat=I love that we have an F8 for sale. I remember when these monsters were for the military only. Just look at the thing. Is that a killer or what? Let's see someone try to mess with you when you're flying one of these.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Freelancer_IG_001_IThinkOver=I think over the years, I've sold more Freelancers than just about anything else. I think it's cause MISC made them real jack of all trades. Plus, they really hold on to their resale value.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Genesis_IG_001_JustBetweenMe=Just between me and you, I've always wanted to own a Genesis. I flew on one with my dad when I was ten. We were going to visit my grandmother, and I don't think I had ever been on a ship that big or fancy before. Since then, there's always been a part of me that wonders what it would be like to be a commercial transport pilot. But maybe you buy this one, and then you can come back and tell me what it's like.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Gladiator_IG_001_TheGladiIs=The Gladi is a fascinting bit of hardware. For being so streamlined, it carries some serious ordnance. Almost like a light heavy.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Gladius_IG_001_GladiusIsFast=Gladius is fast, it's maneuverable, and as all the old timers say, it definitely punches above its weight class.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Glaive_IG_001_PeopleAreAlways=People are always eager to point out that a Glaive is just a Scythe with two blades, but it is so much more than that. You know the Vanduul clans only let the most dangerous and experienced pilots fly a Glaive?
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hammerhead_IG_001_YouKnowWhat=You know what I've always wondered about the Hammerhead? Do you think they came up with the name first and made the ship match, or the other way around? Either way, it's one of the best patrol ships flying today.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hawk_IG_001_TheHawkIs=The Hawk is what I recommend to any bounty hunter who comes in. It's got the speed you need to run someone down, and guns to spare once you catch up with them.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Herald_IG_001_TheHeraldIs=The Herald is definitely one of the more interesting ships we have on the lot. It's not every data runner that comes with its own broadcast array.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_HerculesStarlifter_IG_001_TheHerculesPerforms=The Hercules performs as advertised. Its got the power needed to haul vehicles wherever, whenever. No easy feat.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hornet_IG_001_YouKnowCal=You know, Cal Mason of Squadron 42 flies a Hornet. If anyone knows about fighters, it's that guy.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_HullLine_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking for a hauler, you can't go wrong with a Hull. They were built to handle cargo, and damn if they don't do a good job of it.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hurricane_IG_001_YouKnowIn=You know in Sataball when you sail one to a teammate and they just tap it in, no problem? The Hurricane is the ship version of that. One of you is flying, the other is on the turret, and together you are just taking care of business.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Idris_IG_001_IfYoureActually=If you're actually in the market for something of this size and power, the Idris is a class all its own. She may not be cheap, but would you trust a cheap frigate?
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_KhartuAl_IG_001_TheKhartuStands=The Khartu stands out for a lot of reasons, but those crazy Xi'an stairs alone make it a must buy.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Kraken_IG_001_TheKrakenFollows=The Kraken follows Drake's mantra of why do one thing well when you could do fifty. I've heard of them being used as mini carriers for militias. I've heard of them being used as mobile shopping plazas. Heck, I even heard of one guy who turned the whole thing into some sort of crazy night club. Not that I'm recommending that last one.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_M50_IG_001_IfIHad=If I had it my way, I would be out there flying this bad boy myself. I mean look at those thrusters. The M50 is just begging to be flown.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Mercury_IG_001_YouKnowWhats=You know what's funny about the Mercury? I get people wanting to buy it who don't even want to do data running. They just like the way it looks. Hats off to the Crusader designers on that one.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Mustang_IG_001_YouRememberThe=You remember the Mustang commercial? Where risk meets reward? Well, Consolidated took all the risk, and we get all the reward of being able to fly them. Bottom line is that they are just a fun ship to fly.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Nova_IG_001_WhatABeast=What a beast, right? You think about the war history on these Nova tanks, and it's amazing that you can just walk into a shop these days and buy one yourself. I mean, I used to play with a little toy Nova when I was a kid, and now I get to sell them.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Nox_IG_001_ApparantlyAopoaHad=Apparantly, Aopoa had to modify the Nox for Humans. I guess when Xi'an pilot them, they're bodies naturally enhance the aerodynamics. Our weird Human bodies threw everything out of whack, so they had to reconfigure a lot of things to get it just right for us.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Orion_IG_001_CanYouBelieve=Can you believe that the Orion is a ship that actually flies, and not just some kind of mining station? I mean look at the size of the thing.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_P52Merlin_IG_001_TheP52Is=The P-52 is a great little scrapper to have around to help in a fight. Nimble. Smaller frame which means its harder to hit. And it's easy on the eyes which never hurts.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_P72Archimedes_IG_001_TheArchimedesIs=The Archimedes is the Merlin's more sophisticated sibling. Everything that makes the P-52 so great but a little bit extra sprinkled on top. Definitely would not be out of place if you take it out to the track.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_PTVBuggy_IG_001_ThisLittleBuggy=This little buggy is great for getting around crowded areas like hangars or for short trips around the city.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Pioneer_IG_001_DidYouWatch=Did you watch when Silas Koerner introduced these back at the '47 CitizenCon? Seemed like a pipe dream that a ship could just roll up and start spitting out outposts. Crazy genius did it though, right?
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Polaris_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking to upgrade a militia, the Polaris is a no-brainer. It's got the torpedos. It's got the small craft bay. Vanduul see one of these patrolling a system, and chances are those gullets are running for the nearest jump point.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Prospector_IG_001_HeresTheGreat=Here's the great thing about the Prospector: you go out there and find the right spot to mine, the ship will basically pay for itself.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Prowler_IG_001_HardToBelieve=Hard to believe that our great great great grandparents were going toe to toe with ships just like this. All I can say is I feel damn lucky that T-Vars are on our side now.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Razor_IG_001_WhoWouldHave=Who would have believed that MISC could make a racer this sexy?
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Reclaimer_IG_001_AReclaimerCaptain=A Reclaimer captain once told me that the only ship she hadn't ever salvaged was another Reclaimer. The things are so tough, they just keep flying.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Redeemer_IG_001_RedeemersDesignIs=Redeemer's design is a real winner, and if you're lucky enough to snatch this one up, it could be your next great gunship.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Reliant_IG_001_TheReliantIsnt=The Reliant isn't any old ordinary ship. MISC shoved the thing just chockablock with Xi'an tech. The way it rotates around feels like something out of a sci-fi spec vid.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Retalliator_IG_001_ImPrettySure=I'm pretty sure every captain out there shakes a bit in their boots when they see a Tali drawing near. This is a bomber desinged to inspire fear. The thing was pretty much made to chew through cap ships.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Sabre_IG_001_AegisReallyGot=Aegis really got it right when they were building the Sabre. It's light, but it still has enough going on that it can hold it's own. My only complaint is that the name is a bit close to a Cutlass. I keep having people come in who are confused about which one is which. Not sure how that's possible, but there you go.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_SanTokYai_IG_001_ItMayNot=It may not seem like the obvious choice, but let me tell you, you show up to a fight in one of these badass Xi'an warrior rigs and you are making a bold statement right there my friend.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Scythe_IG_001_YouKnowMy=You know my favorite part of flying a Scythe? The whole thing is just a big F you to all the duul out there. You tried to kill us, and now we're flying your ship and doing it better than you can. It's a real rush.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Starfarer_IG_001_WhenItComes=When it comes to fuel, the Starfarer is the industry standard for a lot of people.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Terrapin_IG_001_IJustLearned=I just learned a little while ago that Terrapin is a kind of turtle. How much more sense does that name make now? You know like how the ship has all this heavy armor plating just like a turtle shell?
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_UsraRover_IG_001_DidYouKnow=Did you know that most new planets found are first explored with the help of an Ursa? They're such a tough and durable rover that it's a natural pick.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Valkyrie_IG_001_ThisThingIs=This thing is less of a ship and more of a mobile fortress. With its heavy armor, you can deliver a full squad of pain and hurt to just about anywhere that needs an ass whoopin.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Vanguard_IG_001_TheVanguardDeep=The Vanguard Deep Space Fighter. If you got a fight in deep space, this is the ship you're gonna want to be flying.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Vulcan_IG_001_MyNephewJust=My nephew just bought himself a Vulcan. Started his own repair service out in Ferron. Refuels, repairs, rearms. He's really doing well for himself. I mean, I was hoping that he would work here with me, but if he's happy that's all that matters, right.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Vulture_IG_001_ThisIsThe=This is the ship you want if you're looking to get into the salvaging game. Plus, you got to admit, the Vulture is just a great name for a ship.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_X1_IG_001_EverybodyWasExcited=Everybody was excited when Origin first announced they were getting into the open canopy market, and when they finally showed the X1, everybody was even more excited. The thing's got style to spare.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Bomer_IG_001_FighterPilotsAlways=Fighter pilots always think they're the heroes, but when it comes right down to it, wouldn't you rather have a ship that can deliver real stopping power like this bomber can?
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Combat_IG_001_IfYouDo=If you do any mercenary work or you're just worried about security, than a fighter like this is a great way to put your mind at ease. Good offense is the best defense, right?
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Data_IG_001_JustTheOther=Just the other week I was watching Kaizen on the spec, and they were going on about how data is gonna be the future. Seems like this would be the perfect time to get data ship of your own.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_DropShip_IG_001_IAlwaysHear=I always hear people talking about space superiority, but for my credits, you're gonna want some boots on the ground. That's where a drop ship like this really shines. You can strategically insert a team where you need, when you need.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Exploration_IG_001_YouHearAbout=You hear about that explorer who discovered those ancient ruins a few weeks back in Elysium? I'm pretty sure they were flying a ship just like this one.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Fuel_IG_001_IAlwaysSay=I always say, you want to see a genuine smile, fly a fuel ship. You'll never feel as appreciated as you do when you top off someone who moments before had been stuck on the drift. Ships like this are the real lifeblood of the 'verse.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Industrial_IG_001_AtTheEnd=At the end of the day, what you really want to know is, can this ship get the job done? And if you're lucky enough to be her new owner, I think you'll know that answer soon enough.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Luxury_IG_001_TheWayI=The way I see it, with as much time as you're gonna spend on board your ship, it really is worth it make sure that you travel in comfort.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Medical_IG_001_ItImpressesMe=It impresses me to no end to think about all the brave men and women out there, risking their lives to help save the lives of others. Takes a real special kind of person to fly a medical ship, no doubt about that.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Mining_IG_001_YouKnowWhats=You know what's great? No matter what the government's doing, who the military's fighting, what system you're in, there's always one constant. People are gonna need resources. That what makes a ship like this such a great investment.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Racing_IG_001_WhetherYouveBeen=Whether you've been racing for years, or you're just looking to get started, she's got what it takes to take home some trophys. All that's missing is the right pilot.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Salvage_IG_001_NowWhileAll=Now, while all the ships we sell are made to last, there's plenty of them out there that aren't so lucky. Salvage ship like this is always in demand.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Snub_IG_001_SnubsMakeA=Snubs make a great addition to any fleet. You want to hit up a moon on the weekend, or just take a fly around a planet, this'll make a quick work of it, and you don't have to spend all the extra credits on flying out a ship bigger than you need.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Support_IG_001_CannotExpressHow=Cannot express how happy it makes me every time I get to sell a ship like this. It's a tough life out on the black, and support ships make it a bit better for everyone. You could say flying a ship like this is almost noble in its own way.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Purchase_EncourageASOP_IG_003_AllRightIm=All right, I'm having the crew bring it around and your new ship should be all ready for you at the ASOPs whenever you want to take her out.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Purchase_PaymentResponse_NotEnoughCredits_IG_001_OhThatsTough=Oh, that's tough. Not enough credits, huh? Maybe something else around here is more in your price range.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Purchase_PaymentResponse_NotEnoughCredits_IG_002_FundsALittle=Funds a little tight, huh? Know how that goes.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Purchase_PaymentResponse_PurchaseCompliment_IG_003_LetMeBe=Let me be the first to congratulate you on your new ship. I hope the two of you will be very happy for years to come.

+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_Copilot_IG_001_GotAnExtra=Got an extra seat in there for a co-pilot, can help run secondary ship functions or maybe just act as a backup pilot so you can get some rest.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_MannedTurret_IG_001_ThisOnesAlso=This one's also got a manned turret, which if you ask me, raises the value ten-fold. I'd rather have a dedicated turret gunner than someone playing a video game remotely.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_Missiles_IG_001_ThisOneComes=This one comes fully stocked with missiles. Nothing changes the tone of a battle faster than guidance-locked ordnance, am I right?
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_Multicrew_IG_001_LookingForA=Looking for a multicrew ship? This one's a beaut. Crewed one myself a couple years ago before I got this gig.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_OpenCanopy_IG_001_WithAllThe=With all the barriers we put between ourselves and our environments, there's something tremendously freeing about piloting without any. Don't you agree?
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_Ramp_IG_001_YoullAlsoFind=You'll also find a convenient ramp on this baby for easy access inside.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_Shower_IG_001_AlsoWhoDoesnt=Also, who doesn't like to keep themselves presentable? Well that is not a concern here, this model comes with a shower.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_SingleSeat_IG_001_ThisOnesFor=This one's for a solo pilot. It's a little bit more work as you have a lot more to pay attention to, but I find there's something satisfying about flying solo.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_VTOL_IG_001_YouveProbablyNoticed=You've probably noticed the VTOL thrusters on this. They'll give you ultra-precise maneuvering when navigating around a landing pad. And require a lot less room to take off.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Aegis_IG_001_IfICan=If I can be honest, if you'd asked me five years ago, I'd have told you that Aegis Dynamics was dead in the water as a manufacturer, but nowadays they are everywhere. Don't get me wrong, they make good ships. This is a good ship. But yeah, it's just interesting is all.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Anvil_IG_001_ThereArentMany=There aren't many manufacturers that have the rep that Anvil ships have. From what I hear, they run every design through a rigorous internal review process before even starting production to make sure the ship is exactly what they want to make. Pretty impressive when you think about it.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Aopoa_IG_001_TheXianMake=The Xi'an make interesting ships, I'll give them that. You don't really see lines like this in Human construction.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Argo_IG_001_PeopleDontReally=People don't really mention Argo when talking about prominent manufacturers, but I guarantee, if you go to any kind of work site, you'll probably see this ship there.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_ConsolidatedOutlands_IG_001_ForMyMoney=For my money, there's no ship manufacturer doing more exciting things than Consolidated Outlands. Silas Koerner's a true visionary. Ships like this are just proof of that.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Crusader_IG_001_OneOfThe=One of the things I like about Crusader ships is that they aren't flashy. They aren't trying to redefine the wheel. They're just creating good ships and creating them well.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Drake_IG_001_YouKnowPeople=You know, people like to give Drake a hard time about the fact that some criminals like to use their ships, but I'll be honest, I've seen outlaws in every kind of ship imaginable. Doesn't change the fact that Drake makes good ships.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Esperia_IG_001_ALotOf=A lot of collectors tend to gravitate to Esperia ships. I'm not into reproductions myself, but just look at it... the level of detail they put into them is pretty staggering.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_GreycatIndustrial_IG_001_ILoveGreycat=I love GreyCat. I'll just say it.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Kruger_IG_001_IActuallyUsed=I actually used to race in a Kruger ship. Long time ago. It was purely amateur, but yeah, I was pretty good. People told me I could'a gone pro.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_MISC_IG_001_IKnowRsi=I know RSI usually gets the credit for building ships for regular people, but if you ask me, it's MISC. I mean, think about it, look at all the industrial ships they've constructed, how engrained they are with hauling, mining, even racing now. I don't know, MISC seems to be making a run for the title.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_OriginJumpworks_IG_001_IDontNeed=I don't need to say anything, right? I mean, an Origin ship is an Origin ship. Just take a moment, look at that. You know what I mean.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_RSI_IG_001_YouCanNever=You can never really go wrong with an RSI ship. It's not the most exciting sales pitch, but it's true. They've pushed innovation for centuries. You don't get to do that if you're making crap.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Tumbril_IG_001_LookingForSome=Looking for some terrestrial technology? Tumbril's a good brand. Though they just relaunched, the tech's been around forever. I guess why fix what isn't broken.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_Busy_WithCustomer_IG_002_WeGotSome=We got some business to discuss. I'll come check on you in a bit.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageBrowsing_IG_004_IllLeaveYou=I'll leave you to it. Always find it's best to sit back, take in the space and let your ship call to you.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageBrowsing_IG_005_HeresWhatYou=Here's what you do. Just walk the place. If I'm making a decision as big as you're making, I like to take everything in before I do anything.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageDecision_IG_003_IllGiveYou=I'll give you a moment. Maybe go for a walk to think it over. That's always been my trick if I want to clear my head and look at the problem fresh.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageInspectShip_IG_001_FeelFreeTo=Feel free to hop in and take a feel. Don't take off though. <laugh> I'm kidding, you can't.

+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageSimCab_IG_003_FeelFreeTo=Feel free to check out our simcab if you wanna see what flying the ship's really like. It's just like the real thing. I promise.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageTerminal_IG_001_WhyDontYou=Why don't you step on over to our terminal if you're looking for additional info. That can take care of you almost as good as I can. Promise.

+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_IG_004_IMeanIts=I mean it's a lot of credits, sure, but what do you really have to think about?
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_UsedShip_IG_001_TheresNothingWrong=There's nothing wrong with buying used, you know. Every single one of mine I've bought secondhand. At least you know it's not gonna blow up the first time you turn it on.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_UsedShip_IG_002_IDontKnow=I don't know why you wouldn't buy used. Sure you don't get the bragging rights of saying it's brand new, but you ask me, used ships got more character.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_UsedShip_IG_003_HonestlyIfIt=Honestly if it were up to me, I'd charge more for used ships. They've been out there. Tested. You know they can deliver. New ships? They got nice paint jobs.

+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Beautiful_IG_002_EverybodyAlwaysStops=Everybody always stops to gawk at this one. Can't blame them really. Sleek lines. Impeccable design. It's a work of art really.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Fast_IG_001_IllLevelWith=I'll level with you. If you're looking to go slow, you need to walk away from this one right here. It's almost a psychological condition. You start up this monster, you'll be peeling metal.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Fast_IG_002_YouGotAn=You got an eye for speed, I see. Well, if that's the case, look no further. This one right here can knock paint off a space station. I had a customer even bring one back because it was too intense.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_GreatDeal_IG_002_YouArentGonna=You aren't gonna find a better deal. Not anywhere in the 'verse.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_HardWorking_IG_001_HeresWhatI=Here's what I like about this model here: fortitude. You can take it out, grind away for hours at a time and this baby'll eat that up and ask for more.

+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_IG_002_WhatYoureLooking=What you're looking at right there is a classic. You get all these people clamoring for the 'newest, hottest thing' but give me worn and tested any day. Everything's great right out of the box, but if you can last, like really last, then you're onto something.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_IG_003_HeresTheThing=Here's the thing, I could hit you with stats, figures, hull compression strength or whatever, but honestly, the decision's been made. You knew from the moment you looked at her.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Safe_IG_001_OneWordComes=One word comes to mind whenever I look at this one: trust. I know that thanks to dependable construction and cutting edge design, it will get me and my loved ones wherever we want to go and get us there in one piece.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Safe_IG_002_HeresTheGreat=Here's the great thing about this ship. It's safe. I know, I know, that sounds like a dirty word, but let me tell you, safe may not be sexiest marketing slang, but it's what all of us are ultimately looking for. Getting somewhere safe is priceless.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Strorage_IG_001_LookingForA=Looking for a transport? You could do a lot worse than this one. Plenty of open space for hauling whatever the hell you want. I mean, you got so much room you could probably haul a little bit of everything and still have SCU to spare.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Strorage_IG_002_OneOfThe=One of the great things about this baby here is space. If you're looking to haul, you can't go wrong with this model. I used this very ship to help move my parents into their new home. One of the easiest moves I've ever made.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_100Series_IG_001_YourEntryInto=Your entry into the world of Origin ships, but don't let that fool you. The 100s got all the excellence and design of its bigger brothers.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_300Series_IG_001_IsThereAnything=Is there anything sexier than a 300 series? The answer to that is yes, the one thing sexier is your 300 series.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_600Series_IG_001_OriginsResponseTo=Origin's response to RSI's Constellation line. Their goal with the 600 was to find that perfect balance between elegance and function. All you got to do is step aboard and you'll quickly realize that they nailed it.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_85X_IG_001_85XIsYour=85x is your weekend, fly over to that artisan deli and grab a picnic type of luxury ship. Simple, elegant, stunning.

+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_ArgoMPUV_IG_001_TheMpuvIs=The MPUV is short for Multi-Purpose Utility Vehicle. Argo has been pumping these things out like crazy. If you go to any kind of factory, hauling or mining facility, I guarantee you're gonna run into ten of them. Needless to say, they're popular for a reason.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Arrow_IG_001_YouWannaKeep=You wanna keep it fast and light. The Arrow's your ship. Anvil built her as a combat alternative to the Gladius. Were they successful? Depends on who you ask, maybe you can tell me where you land on it.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Aurora_IG_001_PeopleLikeTo=People like to sleep on the Aurora. Sure, you line it up against all the other ships in the 'verse and yeah, maybe it's a little weak, but I'll tell you this. I still fly mine every day. How many ships can you say that about?
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Avenger_IG_001_YouGottaLove=You gotta love Avengers. For the longest time, everybody would immediately mistake you for a cop when you flew by. Still do in some parts of the Empire probably.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Blade_IG_001_TheVanduulLight=The Vanduul light fighter, lovingly... is that the right phrase? Anyway, created by the artists over at Esperia. This thing's light, it's nimble and a pitch perfect recreation of the original Vanduul design.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Buccaneer_IG_001_YouTalkTo=You talk to most dogfighters and they'll swear Aegis or Anvil up and down the show, but here's the thing. This bad boy right here is a born scrapper. You got a handful of guns at your disposal and enough speed to keep you out of someone's crosshairs. The rest is up to skill.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Carrack_IG_001_ImNotSure=I'm not sure if you're one of those who hear the call of the unknown, who have that gnawing desire to discover, to see what lies beyond. If that's you, than this... this is what you want at your side.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Caterpillar_IG_001_ImpressiveIsntShe=Impressive, isn't she? Asymmetrical hull design. Multiple cargo compartments to maximize your capacity. Even some crew living quarters for long runs. You know this ship design is almost a hundred years old? It just goes to show that ships don't have to be pretty to be innovative.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Constellation_IG_001_MyBrotherUsed=My brother used to say that he'd only really feel like a success if he could buy a Constellation. That, to him, was the pinnacle of space travel. To be fair, it's a helluva ship.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Crucible_IG_001_IllAdmitI=I'll admit, I was a little surprised to hear that Anvil was doing a repair ship. I guess blowing ships up gives you a pretty solid understanding of how to put them back together.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Cutlass_IG_001_EverybodysGotAn=Everybody's got an opinion on the Cutlass. This was the ship that basically put Drake on the map. Gets a bad rap these days, but I don't know. At the end of the day, the ship's versatile, easy to maintain and affordable. None of that sounds bad to me.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Cyclone_IG_001_CyclonesHaveBeen=Cyclones have been racing around for hundreds of years. Like I always say, if there's something I gotta do planetside, a Cyclone can help pull it off.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Dragonfly_IG_001_ICantRide=I can't ride one of these things. I go too fast. It's just that addictive.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Eclipse_IG_001_TheEclipseJust=The Eclipse just reeks of pure warfare. I mean, come on, stealth bomber? How bad ass is that? I don't even want to bomb anything but this ship makes me want to.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Endeavor_IG_001_IWasAlways=I was always bad at science. Barely passed my classes to get Equivalency. But I got a ton of respect for people who like studying stuff. You strike me as a real intellectual so this ship would probably make a lot more sense to you.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_F8Lightning_IG_001_OhYeahThe=Oh yeah, the F8. It's what I like to call 'combat sexy.' It's got all the tools you need to absolutely wreck people, and it looks so bad ass doing it.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Freelancer_IG_001_ProbablyTheMost=Probably the most popular ship in the entire MiSC line, the Freelancer's become one of the standard go-to's for haulers, explorers, hell, there are even some couriers who use them.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Genesis_IG_001_WeveAllBeen=We've all been on a Genesis at some point in our lives if we've done any kind of interstellar travel. The thing's basically the standard for commercial starliners.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Gladiator_IG_001_AnvilsGladiatorA=Anvil's Gladiator. A lotta people tend to right this bad boy off as a single-function ship. Good at dropping ordnance and not much else. But they forget that it's a multi-seater with a turret and some decent guns.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Gladius_IG_001_GladiusIsA=Gladius is a bonafide classic. I guarantee you walk up to any person, old or young, and they can pick this ship out of a lineup immediately. It's fought in wars, defended homesteads, everything. The Gladius is the dogfighter by which all dogfighters are measured.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Glaive_IG_001_YouWatchThe=You watch the Lost Squad? This is the exact type of ship that... oh what's his name... that Vanduul commander. I can never pronounce it. Anyway, this is what he flies. It's the variant of the Scythe that they give to their aces. Anyway, you should check out the show. It's pretty great.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hammerhead_IG_001_AhTheHammerhead=Ah, the Hammerhead. Not sure if you've ever seen one of these throw down, but... let's just say wow. It's one of those cap ships that's designed to handle fighters. Anyway, when this thing's firing all barrels, Navy pilots used to call it the Bloom of Death. Cool, right?
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hawk_IG_001_AnotherPopularStarter=Another popular starter ship, the Hawk here's been increasingly popular with amateur bounty hunters or anyone who needs to chase people down and shoot at them.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Herald_IG_001_DrakesDataRunner=Drake's data runner is basically the answer to the question of what happens if you strap a cockpit onto a thruster. Not great on turns, but when you're going that fast, who cares.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_HerculesStarlifter_IG_001_OddsAreIf=Odds are if you need to move vehicles from planet to planet, you're looking at one ship. That's this baby right here.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hornet_IG_001_YouGottaLove=You gotta love the Hornet, right? Take a moment, look at her. Sure, she's a little boxy, but is there any ship more associated with space combat than the Hornet? I don't think so. Maybe the Gladius...
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_HullLine_IG_001_WhenYouOnly=When you only care about cargo space and nothing else. No frills. No amenities. Just cargo. There is a Hull for you.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hurricane_IG_001_SpeedAndGuns=Speed and guns. A lethal combination in the right hands. You'll need it too. See the Hurricane here... well, to put it bluntly, isn't the sturdiest of ships. In a nutshell, it's a lot better at dishing out punishment than taking it. Not that I'm trying to dissuade you, just that you should know before buying.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Idris_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking into buying a frigate, I might have to close early today. Aegis' Idris has been the go-to for everybody from the UEE Navy to megacorps. Show up in one of these and I guarantee you make an impression.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_KhartuAl_IG_001_ThisOneWas=This one was the first ship Aopoa was allowed to sell in the UEE. A modification of the Xi'an military's light fighter, the Khartu'al is agile and surgical.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Kraken_IG_001_ALT_ThingsABeast=Thing's a beast, right? A customer of mine, who's very satisfied with this purchase, referred to it as the Human equivalent of the Merchantman. I'm not sure if that's exactly right, but it was a funny analogy.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Kraken_IG_001_ThingsABeast=Thing's a beast, right? Comes as a mobile strike carrier or a mobile marketplace. A customer of mine, who's very satisfied with this purchase, referred to it as the Human equivalent of the Merchantman. I'm not sure if that's exactly right, but it was a funny analogy.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_M50_IG_001_IHopeYou=I hope you aren't allergic to speed. It's damn near impossible to keep a beast like the m50 in anything remotely resembling a reasonably safe speed.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Mercury_IG_001_TheCrusaderReps=The Crusader Reps hate it when I call the Mercury a blockade runner. They think it's implying that it was built for illegal use, but I think it's a compliment. You want to move some cargo or got a courier job but you gotta do it with speed, agility, and pack a nice punch? Mercury's got your back.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Mustang_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking for a versatile starter ship, I personally recommend the Mustang. Silas Koerner's a personal hero of mine and what he's done with this ship is really something.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Nova_IG_001_AnotherBangerFrom=Another banger from Tumbril, the Nova is a modern update of the classic battle tank. This thing can shred targets on the ground or in the air. The main cannon is absolutely deafening. It's pretty cool.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Nox_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking to blast around in a truly futuristic open canopy racer, I can't recommend the Nox enough. The thing absolutely blazes.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Orion_IG_001_RsisDedicatedMining=RSI's dedicated mining platform. The Orion's the one you go to when you need large scale mining solutions.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_P52Merlin_IG_001_CoolRightTheres=Cool, right? There's something to be said about short-range ships. There's a purity to the experience that I kinda lose when I get in the bigger ones.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_P72Archimedes_IG_001_IllBeHonest=I'll be honest, I love taking this baby out for a little spin during breaks. Not this one here, we got another in the back, but seriously, if you're looking for something short-range, the P72 is where it's at. Hands down.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_PTVBuggy_IG_001_ThisLittleBuggy=This little buggy is just what it is. No frills. Dependable and fun as hell to drive. Buddy of mine used to build race tracks for them.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Pioneer_IG_001_ImpressiveIsntIt=Impressive, isn't it? I'm not sure if you read Silas Koerner's last book, but he talked a lot about technology throughout Human history. You ask me, I think this ship's gonna change things. It's opening up planetary settlement in really exciting ways.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Polaris_IG_001_PartOfRsis=Part of RSI's larger capital ship skunkworks, the Polaris is a corvette-class combat vessel. They released it as part of the UEE's Militia Mobilization Initiative, but private Merc companies and even Corporate Security outfits have been snatching them up.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Prospector_IG_001_ThereAreSome=There are some who say the Prospector's just a starter ship. That it's for amateurs, but here's the rub. Sure, it's not taking down massive hauls, but it's for people who like to work.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Prowler_IG_001_EsperiaGotSome=Esperia got some ridiculous access to an original Tevarin model to create this line of replicas. You ask me, this looks like something out of a Spec vid. Back in the war, they'd use these to drop boarders on capital ships. How nuts is that?
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Razor_IG_001_WhenMiscAnnounced=When MISC announced they were jumping into the racing game, I was like 'what?! no way.' but the second you fire up the engines on this puppy... you put away your doubts.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Reclaimer_IG_001_IllTellYou=I'll tell you. If you're looking to chew up some debris, you absolutely cannot go wrong with the Reclaimer. This thing is the patron saint of salvage.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Redeemer_IG_001_TheRedeemerWas=The Redeemer was a bit of an experiment for Aegis, but the gunship has definitely found some supporters in the private contractor arena. You ask me, it's because of those rotating nacelles.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Reliant_IG_001_MiscsReliantIf=MISC's Reliant. If there's anything that signifies how far our relationship with the Xi'an has come, it's this ship. Hell, the damn thing turns vertical like one of theirs.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Retalliator_IG_001_HeresTheThing=Here's the thing, if you need to absolutely bomb something into last week. You need a Retaliator. They been doing it for hundreds of years.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Sabre_IG_001_NowThisThis=Now this, this is a fun ship. While you've got the Hornet for brawling, the Sabre's a more elegant alternative. Fast and precise lethality. I came up with that.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_SanTokYai_IG_001_AopoasReallyUpping=Aopoa's really upping their game in the UEE markets, the San... San'tak... however you pronounce it is supposed to be a scrapper through and through.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Scythe_IG_001_VanduulScytheProbably=Vanduul Scythe. Probably the most known fighter in their armada. This one here? This was captured from a Vanduul defector in Orion. I'm kidding, it's a repro made by Esperia. Looks pretty convincing, right?
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Starfarer_IG_001_OneOfThe=One of the big boys of hauling, you can't really go wrong with the Starfarer.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Terrapin_IG_001_TheTerrapinHere=The Terrapin here, it's got a real interesting history, but you aren't here about history, right? If you want to push out beyond the reach of civilization, search for the new, then this is the ship for you.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_UsraRover_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking to do some planetside exploration, look no further. The Ursa may not have the speed as something like the Cyclone, but it's rugged, dependable and capable of going anywhere.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Valkyrie_IG_001_BeforeIStart=Before I start talking, just take a moment and breathe in this ship. <pause> Anvil's Valkyrie. Designed as a heavy troop transport, it's armed, it's armored, it's a killer.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Vanguard_IG_001_YeahTheVanguard=Yeah, the Vanguard here's one of the newer ones from Aegis. They'd had some older heavy fighters back in the day, but they went back to the drawing board with this one to create something thoroughly modern and undeniably deadly.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Vulcan_IG_001_AegisVulcanSmall=Aegis' Vulcan. Small, mobile refuel and rearm ship. It's perfect for do-gooder types and budding entrepreneurs. This is one of those ships that pays for itself. You get one of these out on the drift and I guarantee you'll be pulling in credits in no time.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Vulture_IG_001_LookingToCrack=Looking to crack into the salvage game? I don't blame you. There's some good money in it. My dad dragged scrap for years and never hated a day of work. Drake dropped the Vulture here to provide a small, solo option for salvage pilots.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_X1_IG_001_OriginsAdditionTo=Origin's addition to the open canopy market. Spared no expense either. Aside from the usual Origin quality, they even brought back Alberto Vara to design the thing, so it's not just fast, but beautiful.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Bomer_IG_001_BeCarefulIm=Be careful! I'm just kidding. This bad boy's a devastator though. Capable of delivering ordnance with surgical precision. Now, I don't know what you're looking to blow up with this, but I'll just say that whatever it is, it doesn't stand a chance.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Combat_IG_001_WellIfYoure=Well, if you're looking to tear it up with somebody, you could do a lot worse than this one here. This one's a surefire, Grade-A certified brawler.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Data_IG_001_AfterThatOrigin=After that Origin hack from a few years ago, everybody's putting more stock in securing their data, so ships like this are becoming more and more in demand.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_DropShip_IG_001_WhatYoureLooking=What you're looking at here is a combat juggernaut. It's got firepower, sure. Armor, check. But it's really designed to punch through defenses and deliver troops. Here's the thing though, dropships like this aren't only good for dropping people off, they make excellent extraction ships too.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Exploration_IG_001_IAlwaysAdmired=I always admired people who wanted to explore the universe. I'm too much of a homebody. Take me away from anytime food delivery and spectrum feeds and I lose my mind.

+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Industrial_IG_001_IndustrialShipsAre=Industrial ships are definitely a bit of a niche market, but without fail, I hear good things about this one here.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Luxury_IG_001_YouCantReally=You can't really put a price on luxury. I mean, you can obviously, but in a larger sense, the ability to travel in the ultimate comfort in an environment designed in the pursuit of pure excellence can't really be quantified.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Medical_IG_001_WeDontHave=We don't have a lot of medical ships and to be honest, I'm not as schooled about them, but I've heard good things about this one. Paramedic from Ferron came through last week and gave me the run down.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Mining_IG_001_MyOldMan=My old man was a miner. Sixty years sledging rock on planets, asteroids, you name it, he cracked it. I learned early on, that life wasn't for me, but if it's something that you're looking into pursuing, you can't go wrong with this ship here.
+ PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Racing_IG_001_RacerHuhYouve=Racer, huh? You've got that look. Well, if you need a new rig, this one can definitely sort you out. Speed, agility, all the things that'll pay out in spades on the track.

+ TarPits_ShipStrip_desc_001=Got a particular salvage job that we could use some extra hands on. \n\nWe need you to find a ~mission(ship) that got punched out around ~mission(location). Securityâ€™s already searching for it and if they find it, theyâ€™ll ID it for sure and weâ€™ll be in loads of trouble.\n\nSo, we want you to scrape it clean before anybody else gets eyes on it. Rip the entire hull off so nobody can tell who it belonged to, donâ€™t leave a speck of paint, and obviously keep your mouth shut about anything you see. \n\nWeâ€™ll cred you up and anything you scrap is yours to keep. But if security finds the ship before youâ€™re done, weâ€™ll all be screwed and you wonâ€™t get paid so donâ€™t disappoint.

+ TarPits_TimedSalvage_Desc_01=Weâ€™ve got our eye on a ~mission(ship) near ~mission(location) thatâ€™s ripe for salvaging. Weâ€™re too busy to snag it ourselves, so why not spread the wealth, right?\n\nIf you send us some credits, weâ€™ll send you the shipâ€™s exact coordinates. Donâ€™t take too long to think it over, though. Youâ€™ve probably got about ~mission(timer) minutes until security gets there to check out the wreck. Could be more, could be less.\n\nIf youâ€™re fast enough, you can get in, get your haul, and get out without a shot fired. Not a bad deal, right? And once you've salvaged everything you want, just go ahead and abandon this contract to clear your map. Helps keep everything nice and tidy.
+ TarPits_TimedSalvage_Desc_02_ChickenShip=We got word that Adagio has a salvage contract coming for a ~mission(ship). If youâ€™re interested in swooping in, we can sell you the coordinates for a nice discount. Gotta decide fast, though.\n\nSome unlucky salvager will probably buy the rights to the claim soon, but our guess is that itâ€™ll take at least ~mission(timer) minutes until they get there. If they see you picking at their claim, they might call security on you but if youâ€™re any good you should have plenty of time. And if youâ€™re slow, I guess you can just shoot them down before they send word to anyone, right?

While many Humans spend their lives never leaving their homeworld, there are those who choose to travel aboard advanced starships, braving outlaws, hostile aliens, and hazardous conditions to seek their fortune.  \n\nCurrently, you are in Area18, on ArcCorp, the third planet in the Stanton System â€“ a great distance from Humanityâ€™s origins in the Sol System. The four planets in the system are owned by megacorporations who each purchased a planet from the UEE and now govern their own region of space. They are: Hurston Dynamics, Crusader Industries, ArcCorp, and microTech. \n\nArea18 is the main commercial zone of the mega-city that sprawls across the surface of ArcCorp. From here, the tutorial will guide you to Baijini Point, the space station in orbit above the planet that can serve as your gateway to further exploration of the Stanton system.

The option you are currently selecting will be highlighted in a brighter color than the other options. \n\nYou can also Quick Interact with objects to do the main action associated with it. For example, Quick Interacting with a closed door will open it. It'll also pick up an item, loot a container, and switch lights on or off.\n\nYou can also use Interaction Mode to zoom in or zoom out on objects youâ€™re looking at. When interacting with an interface, you can also scroll through the list of available options on the display. For example, you can scroll through the list of floor options while interacting with an elevator panel.\n\nFor all manners of interaction, you may prefer to use different keybinds. To view all the current keybinds or adjust them, use the Keybinding tab of the Options menu.

+ Tut02_Journal01_Trading_Content=The universe of Star Citizen has many unique pieces of equipment and clothing for you to use. These items may be looted from adversaries but can also be purchased from the numerous stores around the â€کverse. Specialized stores at major landing zones tend to have the necessary stock to cover your basic needs, whereas quieter areas might have unique variants or niche equipment.\n\nTo buy an item on display, approach it and enter Interaction Mode. The brand logo, item name, and price will be displayed, as well as options to BUY, TRY ON, or INSPECT the item. If you like what you see and have the necessary funds, selecting the BUY option will open your mobiGlas so you can complete the purchase.\n\nYou can also use Interaction Mode to browse the shopping kiosks. While these kiosks are not as hands-on, it is easier to buy goods in volume through the kiosk interfaces. Kiosks also give you the option to choose where the items will be delivered â€“ either to your local storage or directly to your personal inventory.\n\nTo sell items, first make sure that they are in your personal inventory, local storage, or are cargo on a vehicle stored at that location. Then you can interact with a shopping kiosk at a store and use the â€œSELLâ€‌ tab. From there you will be given options to select which items you wish to sell. Not all stores will purchase all items.\n\nPERSONAL INVENTORY\nYour Personal Inventory is the storage on your character. You can use this screen to arrange and organize your items, transferring them between your Personal Inventory and Local Storage or equipping them to your character. Take note that certain items have requirements for when they can be equipped, such as armor needing to be placed on an undersuit. All inventories have a capacity bar near the top that indicates how much they can store. \n\nLOCAL STORAGE\nYour Local Storage is unique to the current zone you are in. For example, if you are on microTech you will no longer have access to your Area18 storage. While Local Storages are significantly larger than Personal Inventories, they still have their own maximum capacity.\n\nAs you accumulate a high number of items, you can use the tabs at the top of the Local Inventory window to filter through specific categories of items and equipment.\n\nVehicles also have their own storage capacity. This inventory is not shared with any other players aboard and remains accessible to you while onboard the vehicle or while that vehicle is parked at your current landing zone.\n\nLOSING ITEMS\nRemember, when you get into dangerous situations out in the â€کverse you risk losing your items! Things in your personal inventory at the time of your death will remain on your corpse and will need to be retrieved. The same is true when a vehicle is destroyed. There is a chance that other players will find and claim your lost items before you can.\n\nAnything in storage at a major city landing zone is safe regardless of what happens to you or your vehicles.

Anything theyâ€™re going those lengths to hideâ€™s got to be worth something, right? Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re shelling out primo creds to anyone willing to breach the facility, snag the confidential materials, and drop them off at ~mission(dropoff1|address) for us.\n\nGonna be honest with you, part of why weâ€™re not doing this one ourselves is itâ€™s probably gonna be a mess. See, the confidential materials arrived alongside other boxes in a consignment now stored in their automated vault and the retrieval codes for that are only generated on-site. That means no remote hacking. Our source claims senior staff carry datapads with the codes on it, so youâ€™ll have to liberate datapads off them before using the codes at the package conveyor to retrieve the boxes. \n\nBut the gigâ€™s got some perks. The consignment includes other crates that we donâ€™t really give a crap about that are probably worth something too. \n\nSo what do you say?\n\n- Bit Zeros \n

+ blacjac_RetrieveConsignment_desc_001=ATTN: Mercenaries with Cargo Handling Experience\n\nNine Tails are currently assaulting one of our facilities at ~mission(Location|address). As they just received a delivery of confidential materials, we donâ€™t believe this is a coincidence. BlacJac needs someone to hurry to the location and secure these important boxes before the Nine Tails do. You are authorized to use lethal force against any who attempt to stop you. \n\nAs part of our standard security protocol, the confidential materials were integrated into another consignment and secured in the automated vault. Youâ€™ll need to find the relevant retrieval codes for the consignment and enter it at the package conveyor to retrieve the boxes. Retrieval codes are stored locally on datapads and only given to high-ranking staff, so youâ€™ll have to locate them first. Hopefully theyâ€™re alive to help you, but considering the complete comms blackout, we fear thatâ€™s not the case.  \n\nOnce youâ€™ve gathered all the confidential materials, they will need to be delivered to ~mission(dropoff1|address). Payment is contingent upon their delivery.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"

Livingston\nRISK ASSESSMENT: High\nRUSH CONTRACT: Yes\n\nHurston has learned that the Nine Tails are attacking ~mission(Location|address). Our on-site forces have suffered heavy casualties and stopped responding to comms. Initial reports indicated that the gang was attempting to obtain confidential material recently delivered to the facility. Thankfully, we have security measures in place that should give us time to respond. We need an operative to head to the facility immediately, retrieve those boxes, and deliver them to a secure location.\n\nYou and whatever backup you choose to bring are authorized to take any actions necessary when confronting the trespassers. Suspects are considered armed and dangerous. Hurston will not provide material support and/or updates regarding the status of the facility's security forces. \n\nThe confidential materials were discreetly delivered alongside other boxes in a consignment and locked in our automated vault. The retrieval codes needed to access them are kept on datapads held by senior security staff. Find those datapads and then enter the consignment codes at the package conveyor to retrieve the boxes. Payment will be sent once all confidential materials have been delivered to ~mission(dropoff1|address). \n\n\n** The information transmitted may contain confidential and/or privileged material. Any review, retransmission, dissemination, or other use of or taking action in reliance upon this information by persons or entities other than the intended recipient is prohibited. **

Iâ€™ve just learned of a battle near ~mission(Location) thatâ€™s just transpired far from the prying eyes of any meddlesome comm arrays, and reinforcements from either of the forces involved have yet to be dispatched. This means that there is a window of opportunity for an enterprising soul to pick the graveyard clean.\n \nIâ€™d like to extend this opportunity to all my trusted contacts. Any and all interested parties can have the locationâ€¦ for the right price. Coordinates will be provided once you accept the contract and will remain available until you choose to terminate it.\n\nOf course, speed will be of the essence as you will not only face potential competition from other salvagers, but also the looming possibility of reinforcements arriving to survey the battlefield. \n\nIf youâ€™re still hesitating, just remember, fortune favors the bold.\n\n-cd

+ mg_pacheco_DestroyEvidence_desc_001=It turns out that security over at ~mission(location|address) got their hands on a box of evidence that shouldnâ€™t exist. Iâ€™m gonna pay you to destroy it for me.\n\nGetting to the evidence wonâ€™t be a walk in the park. Youâ€™ll have to make it past the stationâ€™s heavy security, and then take out the Chief of Security in order to get their access code to the Evidence Storage Unit. And even thatâ€™s not straightforward since the Chief only deals with high-level emergencies so Iâ€™m thinking youâ€™ll have to shoot up the place pretty good before they feel itâ€™s worth showing up. Bringing a crew with you is probably a good idea.\n\nOnce the Evidence Inventory System is started up, the box I want should be easy to find - it's blue and has "EVIDENCE" written on it. Destroy that and Iâ€™ll get you paid.\n\nWhat you do after that is up to you. Thereâ€™s probably plenty of other valuable crap locked up in the Evidence Storage if youâ€™re willing to hang around long enough to grab it, but thatâ€™s on you.\n\n-Twitch\n

+ mg_pacheco_StealEvidence_desc_001=Long story short, one of my people got pinched with some evidence that could make things very uncomfortable for me and some of my associates. Thatâ€™s why I want you to go to ~mission(location|address) and steal it for me.\n\nIt wonâ€™t be easy. Not only is the station crawling with security, but the access code to activate the Evidence Storage Unit is kept by the Chief of Security. In order to get to them, youâ€™ll need to create enough havoc to force the Chief to come deal with you in person. I usually donâ€™t like loud and messy, but this job calls for it. It wouldn't be a bad idea to bring a crew along to help.\n\nOn the bright side, the evidence I want should be easy to spot. The box is blue and says "EVIDENCE" on the side. Anything else you want to take from storage and sell is fine with me as long as you remember that Iâ€™m your priority. \n\nOnce you have my evidence, drop it off at ~mission(destination|address) and we can call it a day.\n\n-Twitch\n
+ mg_pacheco_StealEvidence_desc_002=I'll spare you the details, but I need a bit of leverage in a tricky negotiation and know exactly where to get it. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m sending you to go to ~mission(location|address) and steal a box of evidence for me.\n \nNow, I wonâ€™t lie to you. The jobâ€™s a toughy. The station is thick with security and the only access code to the Evidence Storage Unit is kept by the Chief of Security. To make things worse, that snotty bastard doesnâ€™t like to get their hands dirty unless itâ€™s a full-blown emergency which means that youâ€™ll have to escalate things before the Chief will even bother coming round.\n\nOnce you do activate the Evidence Inventory System, the box I want should be the first one out. Now, there might be more boxes coming out after it, you can consider those your bonus payment. \n\nJust be sure that you take care of dropping off my evidence at ~mission(destination|address) first and foremost.\n\n-Twitch\n

+ mg_ruto_RetrieveConsignment_desc_001=Oh hello, I recently overheard a little bit of intel that ~mission(location|address) received some confidential materials that are of great interest to an acquaintance of mine. So interesting that theyâ€™re willing to pay for someone to storm the facility, grab the goods, and deliver them to ~mission(dropoff|address). Now I expect there to be plenty of security, who will most likely put up a fight, so Iâ€™d bring a gun or two. \n\nWord is the confidential materials were delivered in a consignment alongside other stuff and are now being stored in the facilityâ€™s automated vault. Senior security officers on-site carry datapads containing retrieval codes used to access the vault. Youâ€™ll have to get your hands on a datapad before using the package conveyor to retrieve the boxes. \n\nIf you need a little sweetener, Iâ€™ve seen the manifest and can confirm that the other crates being stored at the facility are pretty choice.

+ mg_ruto_clearcrimestat_norep_desc_01=Hi there. We havenâ€™t had a chance to work together yet but Iâ€™m in a bit of a bind here and I could use another body. Not for nothing, of course. Iâ€™m all for a good quid pro quo.\n\nOne of my associates who was serving some time in Klescher was supposed to bring me a datachip, but then they went quiet. Now Iâ€™m assuming theyâ€™re dead, but hereâ€™s the deal: if you finish his job, I wipe your crimestat. Not bad, right?\n\nYour predecessor was apparently planning on using some old tunnels to make his escape. He made it sound like they weren't exactly the easiest thing to access, but I trust you can figure it out. I'm guessing you'll find his body somewhere in there and if weâ€™re lucky, he'll still have the chip on him.\n\nOnce you get it, finish getting out however you can. Then get the data to me. Thereâ€™s a spot nearby you can upload the chipâ€™s contents. You might want to watch out for Hurston Security, though. They've been a hassle lately, so I wouldn't be surprised if you ran into them. After I get the data and validate it, Iâ€™ll wipe your crimestat. \n\nThen you can go and enjoy your newfound freedom. If you do this right, maybe Iâ€™ll have more lucrative work for you down the line.

+ mg_ruto_clearcrimestat_rep_desc_01=Hey there. I heard you ended up in Klescher which is a real drag. But it might actually be a lucky day for both of us.\n\nLong story short, I had somebody sneaking a datachip out of the prison, but they never got back to me. I know for a fact they havenâ€™t left the facility, so I think something might have happened to them. While tragic, business must carry on. If you can get the chip and finish the job, I can clear your crimestat for you. What do you say?\n\nOf course, I don't know exactly how far they got, but I can tell you that the prison's got a whole network of hidden tunnels my guy was planning on using to make his escape. My guess is his corpse is rotting away somewhere there.\n\nOnce you find the body, Iâ€™m hoping the chip will still be on him. When youâ€™ve got it, finish escaping and get the data to me. Thereâ€™s a spot nearby you can upload the chipâ€™s contents. \n\nOne warning though, you might want to watch out for Hurston Security. They've been a hassle lately, so I wouldn't be surprised if you ran into them.\n\nWhen I've got the data Iâ€™ll wipe your crimestat and then, voila, youâ€™ll be free and clear. What you do after that is entirely up to you.

The location is currently under attack and security forces on-site are unresponsive and presumed dead. We believe confidential materials recently delivered to the facility for temporary holding were the target of the raid. Your main focus will be collecting those boxes and delivering them to a secure location.  \n\nFor security reasons, the confidential materials were delivered as part of a larger shipment and secured in the automated vault. The materials have unique retrieval codes that must be entered on the keypad at the package conveyor. Protocols require that only senior security officers can carry a datapad containing a code, so youâ€™ll have to locate them before retrieving the boxes. Once secured, deliver all of the confidential materials to ~mission(dropoff1) for payment.\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\nâ€¢ Provide own transportation to ~mission(Location|address).\nâ€¢ Use force as necessary to collect the confidential materials.\nâ€¢ Deliver the confidential materials to ~mission(dropoff1|address).\n\nMINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS\nâ€¢ 2 years of combined mercenary and/or security experience.\nâ€¢ Access to combat equipment. \nâ€¢ Access to a spaceship that can transport cargo.\nâ€¢ Available for immediate deployment.\n\nPREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS\nâ€¢ Experience with rapid hostility de-escalation techniques.\nâ€¢ Experience hauling important cargo.

+ shubin_claimsweep_desc_easy=POSTING: Security / Mercenary \nLOCATION: ~mission(LagrangeLocation)\nWORK EXPERIENCE: Combat Pilot (Military Experience a Plus)\nTERMS*: \nWe just received word that a Shubin contractor was chased off one of our claims by outlaws who are operating there illegally. Further complicating matters, they have set up a few orbital sentries to protect themselves while they mine. \n\nOur hope is to contract with a mercenary who can search for and destroy the sentries at ~mission(location). If you do encounter an illegal miner at the site, be mindful that it is common practice for these types to contact reinforcements for assistance. It might be better to neutralize them as quickly as possible before they can do so. \n\n\n\n\n*Shubin Interstellar is an equal opportunity contractor. By accepting this contract you are assuming any and all risks associated with the work outlined herein and in no way can Shubin Interstellar be held accountable for any damages accrued during the duration of the contract.\n
+ shubin_claimsweep_desc_hard=POSTING: Security / Mercenary \nLOCATION: ~mission(LagrangeLocation)\nWORK EXPERIENCE: Combat Pilot (Military Experience a Plus)\nTERMS*: \nA local Stanton independent mining team was working ~mission(Location) as Shubin Interstellar contractors when a hostile force attacked and took over the site. We believe that the perpetrators are still at the claim using the equipment left behind to harvest the valuable ore there for themselves.\n\nAmong the equipment lost were a handful of orbital sentries that had unfortunately not yet been fully deployed at the time of the attack. Long range scans of the claim have led us to conclude that the outlaws have activated the orbital sentries and are using them to protect their illegal operations.\n\nTo reclaim the site, we are seeking contractors to go to ~mission(Location), destroy the orbital sentries, and clear the site of hostile miners. Efficiency is strongly recommended as there is a high risk they will call for reinforcements once they discover theyâ€™re being evicted. \n\n\n\n\n*Shubin Interstellar is an equal opportunity contractor. By accepting this contract you are assuming any and all risks associated with the work outlined herein and in no way can Shubin Interstellar be held accountable for any damages accrued during the duration of the contract.\n
+ shubin_claimsweep_desc_intro=POSTING: Security / Mercenary \nLOCATION: ~mission(LagrangeLocation)\nWORK EXPERIENCE: Combat Pilot (Military Experience a Plus)\nTERMS*: \nIt was recently discovered that a Shubin mining claim has been illegally poached by a rogue miner. While the miner themselves seems to no longer be stealing ore from the site, they did leave behind an orbital sentry which is preventing us from reclaiming it thanks to its offensive capabilities.\n\nWe are looking for a mercenary willing to travel to ~mission(location) hunt down the sentry and destroy it in preparation for Shubin repossession of the site.\n\n\n\n\n*Shubin Interstellar is an equal opportunity contractor. By accepting this contract you are assuming any and all risks associated with the work outlined herein and in no way can Shubin Interstellar be held accountable for any damages accrued during the duration of the contract.\n
+ shubin_claimsweep_desc_med=POSTING: Security / Mercenary \nLOCATION: ~mission(LagrangeLocation)\nWORK EXPERIENCE: Combat Pilot (Military Experience a Plus)\nTERMS*: \nA recently acquired Shubin Interstellar mining claim awaiting processing was discovered to have been jumped by a rogue mining outfit who are actively stealing ore from the site.  While local authorities have been notified, there is concern that valuable assets may be harvested before an official investigation can be launched.\n\nTherefore, as is our right as claim holders, we wish to secure a mercenary force to go to ~mission(Location) and destroy the several orbital sentries that are protecting this illegal operation. Caution is advised as there may still be a few illegal miners at the location along with any reinforcements they muster. \n\n\n\n\n*Shubin Interstellar is an equal opportunity contractor. By accepting this contract you are assuming any and all risks associated with the work outlined herein and in no way can Shubin Interstellar be held accountable for any damages accrued during the duration of the contract.\n
+ shubin_claimsweep_desc_rand=POSTING: Security / Mercenary \nLOCATION: ~mission(LagrangeLocation)\nWORK EXPERIENCE: Combat Pilot (Military Experience a Plus)\nTERMS*: \nWhile conducting a survey of Shubin claims in the sector, we were disheartened to learn that a small team of outlaws have set up shop at ~mission(Location) and have been illegal harvesting resources. Worse, they have established a defensive perimeter with several orbital sentries dotted around the site making it difficult for us to evict them. \n\nIn order that we may repossess the claim site, we are seeking mercenary contractors to find and destroy the handful of orbital sentries. Adding additional difficulty to the task is that we are unclear as to the exact fighting strength of these outlaw miners. If they are given the chance to summon reinforcements expect anything from a small contingency to a full squad of trained fighters. \n\n\n\n\n*Shubin Interstellar is an equal opportunity contractor. By accepting this contract you are assuming any and all risks associated with the work outlined herein and in no way can Shubin Interstellar be held accountable for any damages accrued during the duration of the contract.\n
